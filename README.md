# Python Recipes

This is a collection of Python recipes developed or collected throughout years
of practicing Python. Some recipes have been inspired or designed by others and
whenever it can be remembered, tribute to original authors is given.

These recipes are given back to the community in gratitude for what I have been
able to draw from it. Feel free to copy, modify, use, or distribute.
